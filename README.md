# say hello [USER] to your new [ADVENTURE]

## Artist Statement

My work, *say hello [USER] to your new [ADVENTURE]*, is a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure narrative game built entirely for the web, existing only as code and browser interaction. Using Daggerheart mechanics and web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I designed the project to make player choices genuinely matter through branching dialogue, real-time dice-rolling with Hope and Fear trackers, and character selection. The visual design reinforces this agency: you're positioned at the center of the interface, flanked by your character sheet and dialogue history. This centeredness carries through from the main menu to the thank you page, creating a cohesive experience. The artwork's title personalizes that experience, addressing you directly as [USER] entering your own [ADVENTURE]. This story is yours alone. Through this piece, I celebrate what makes the web special: interactivity, directness, and the ability to create experiences that respond uniquely to individuals. This work can only exist online, and only lives when someone chooses to play it.
